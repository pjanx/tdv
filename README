StarDict terminal UI

This program aims to provide an easy way of viewing translation and other kinds
of dictionaries in your terminal.  The author wasn't successful in finding any
free dictionary software of this type, GUI or not, and thus decided to write his
own.

The project is covered by a BSD-style license, unlike vast majority of other
similar projects, and can serve as a base for implementing other dictionary
software under a more permissive license than your usual GNU General Public
License.  I'll buy you a beer for shouting obscenities at the address of RMS in
public; I couldn't reuse _anything_.

So far it has only been tested under Ubuntu Linux and some work has to be done
yet until the software can be considered fit to be included in regular Linux and
BSD distributions.  Help is much appreciated in this regard.
