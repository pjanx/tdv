StarDict terminal UI
====================

This program aims to provide an easy way of viewing translation and other kinds
of dictionaries in your terminal.  The author wasn't successful in finding any
free dictionary software of this type, GUI or not, and thus decided to write his
own.

The project is covered by a BSD-style license, unlike vast majority of other
similar projects, and can serve as a base for implementing other dictionary
software under a more permissive license than your usual GNU General Public
License.  I'll buy you a beer for shouting obscenities at the address of RMS in
public; I couldn't reuse _anything_.

Some work has to be done yet before the software can be considered fit for
inclusion in regular Linux and BSD distributions.  Help is much appreciated in
this regard.

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: CMake, pkg-config, xsltproc, ncursesw, zlib, glib-2.0,
                    pango, termo (included), gtk+ (optional, any version)

 $ git clone https://github.com/pjanouch/sdtui.git
 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_GTK=ON
 $ make

To install the application, you can do either the usual:
 $ make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:
 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i sdtui-*.deb

Note that for versions of CMake before 2.8.9, you need to prefix cpack with
`fakeroot' or file ownership will end up wrong.

Having the program installed, simply run it with a StarDict .ifo file as an
argument.  If you want the application to watch the X11 primary selection for
changes and automatically search for the selected text, use the -w switch.
This feature requires GTK+.

Dictionaries
------------
Unfortunately this application only really works with specific dictionaries.
Word definitions have to be in plain text, separated by newlines.
