Name
----
tdv - Translation dictionary viewer

Synopsis
--------
*tdv* [_OPTION_]... [_DICTIONARY_.ifo]...

Description
-----------
*tdv* is a StarDict dictionary viewer, custom-tailored for translation
dictionaries, with a simple curses-based terminal UI, and a GTK+ graphical UI.

Without any command line arguments, the program expects to find a list of
dictionaries to load on start-up in its configuration file.  The _.ifo_ files
contain information required to load dictionaries from their accompanying
database files.

Options
-------
*-h*, *--help*::
	Display a help message and exit.

*-V*, *--version*::
	Output version information and exit.

Configuration
-------------
You can start your _tdv.conf_ file with the following snippet:

 [Settings]
 center-search = true     # Ensure visibility of preceding entries?
 underline-last = false   # Underline the last line of entries?
 hl-common-prefix = true  # Highlight the longest common prefix?
 watch-selection = true   # Watch X11 selection for changes?

The _watch-selection_ option makes the application watch the X11 PRIMARY
selection for changes and automatically search for any selected text.
This feature requires XCB.  Wayland is currently unsupported,
but would require a compositor supporting the wlr-data-control protocol.
Luckily, some compositors, such as Sway, synchronize selections with Xwayland.

To set up automatically loaded dictionaries, use the following scheme:

// AsciiDoc would otherwise like to process tildes as a long subscript.
:tilde: ~

[subs="normal"]
 [Dictionaries]
 _name 1_ = __{tilde}/path/to/dict.ifo__
 _name 2_ = __{tilde}/another/dict.ifo__

The left-hand side keys define their appearance in the tab bar.

Finally, to make the program look nicer in 256color black-on-white terminals,
rather than rely on the universal default, try:

 [Colors]
 header = reverse
 header-active = ul
 search = ul
 even = 16 231
 odd = 16 255

Terminal attributes are accepted in a format similar to that of *git-config*(1),
only named colours aren't supported.

Extensions
----------
Because the StarDict file format is a bit of a clusterfuck with regard to
collation of dictionary entries, this software introduces an additional,
optional "collation" field into the _.ifo_ file.  When *tdv* discovers this
field while reading a dictionary, it automatically reorders the index according
to that locale (e.g., "cs_CZ").  This operation may take a little while,
in the order of seconds.

Files
-----
*tdv* follows the XDG Base Directory Specification.

_~/.config/tdv/tdv.conf_::
	The configuration file.
