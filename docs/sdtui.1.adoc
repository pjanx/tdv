Name

sdtui - StarDict terminal UI

Synopsis
--------
*sdtui* [_OPTION_]... [_DICTIONARY_.ifo]...

Description
-----------
*sdtui* is a StarDict dictionary viewer custom tailored for viewing translation
dictionaries, using a simple curses-based terminal UI.

The program expects to find on its command line the path to a dictionary's
_.ifo_ file, which contains further information required to load the dictionary.

Some options as well as dictionaries to load on start-up by default can be
specified in a configuration file.  See the README for an example.

// FIXME: the README isn't even installed, so this manual isn't very useful

Options
-------
*-h*, *--help*::
	Display a help message and exit.

*-V*, *--version*::
	Output version information and exit.

Files
-----
_~/.config/sdtui/sdtui.conf_::
	The configuration file, in which you can configure some settings, terminal
	colours and the set of dictionaries to be loaded automatically on start-up.
