StarDict Terminal UI
====================

'sdtui' aims to provide an easy way of viewing translation as well as other
kinds of dictionaries in your terminal, and is inspired by the dictionary
component of PC Translator.  I wasn't successful in finding any free software
of this kind, GUI or not, and thus decided to write my own.

The project is covered by a permissive license, unlike vast majority of other
similar projects, and can serve as a base for implementing other dictionary
software.

Packages
--------
Regular releases are sporadic.  git master should be stable enough.  You can get
a package with the latest development version from Archlinux's AUR.

Documentation
-------------
See the link:docs/sdtui.1.adoc[man page] for information about usage.
The rest of this README will concern itself with externalities.

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: CMake, pkg-config, asciidoctor +
Runtime dependencies: ncursesw, zlib, ICU, termo (included), glib-2.0 >= 2.38,
                      pango, xcb, xcb-xfixes (the latter two optional)

 $ git clone --recursive https://git.janouch.name/p/sdtui.git
 $ mkdir sdtui/build
 $ cd sdtui/build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_X11=ON
 $ make

To install the application, you can do either the usual:

 # make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:

 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i sdtui-*.deb

Having the program installed, simply run it with a StarDict '.ifo' file as
an argument.  It is, however, preferable to
link:docs/sdtui.1.adoc#_configuration[configure it] to load your dictionaries
automatically.

Dictionaries
------------
Unfortunately, this application only really works with specific dictionaries.
Word definitions have to be in plain text, separated by newlines.

The `make dicts` command will build some examples from freely available sources.

You may use the included 'transform' tool to convert already existing
dictionaries that are almost good as they are, e.g., after stripping XML tags.
You might want to fix up the `sametypesequence` of the resulting '.ifo' file
afterwards, and run 'dictzip' on the resulting '.dict' file to make it compact.

Further Development
-------------------
While I've been successfully using 'sdtui' for many years now, some work has to
be done yet before the software can be considered fit for inclusion in regular
Linux and/or BSD distributions.

An approximate list of things that need to be resolved is as follows:

 - the tab bar and the text input field don't handle overflows well,
 - figure out a way to become capable of displaying most StarDict dictionaries.

Given the entangledness of this codebase, issues with the file format,
and general undesirability of terminal UIs, it might be better to start anew.
