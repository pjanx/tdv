StarDict Terminal UI
====================

'sdtui' aims to provide an easy way of viewing translation as well as other
kinds of dictionaries in your terminal.  I wasn't successful in finding any free
dictionary software of this kind, GUI or not, and thus decided to write my own.

The project is covered by a permissive license, unlike vast majority of other
similar projects, and can serve as a base for implementing other dictionary
software.  I wasn't able to reuse _anything_.

Further Development
-------------------
While I've been successfully using sdtui for a long time now, some work has to
be done yet before the software can be considered fit for inclusion in regular
Linux and/or BSD distributions.  Help is much appreciated.

An approximate list of things that need to be resolved:

 - rewrite the frontend using a proper TUI framework
 - load a list of installed dictionaries at startup (use the default locations
   used by StarDict) and let the user choose which dictionary to open
 - figure out a way to become capable of displaying most dictionaries

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: CMake, pkg-config, xsltproc, docbook-xsl +
Runtime dependencies: ncursesw, zlib, ICU, termo (included),
                      glib-2.0, pango, gtk+ (optional, any version)

 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/pjanouch/sdtui.git
 $ mkdir sdtui/build
 $ cd sdtui/build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_GTK=ON
 $ make

To install the application, you can do either the usual:

 # make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:

 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i sdtui-*.deb

Note that for versions of CMake before 2.8.9, you need to prefix `cpack` with
`fakeroot` or file ownership will end up wrong.

Having the program installed, simply run it with a StarDict '.ifo' file as an
argument.  If you want the application to watch the X11 primary selection for
changes and automatically search for the selected text, use the `-w` switch.
This feature requires GTK+.

Extensions
----------
As the original StarDict is a bit of a clusterfuck with regard to collation of
dictionary entries, I had to introduce an additional `collation` field into the
'.ifo' file.  When sdtui discovers this field while reading the dictionary, it
automatically reorders the index according to that locale (e.g. "cs_CZ").
This operation may take a little while.

Dictionaries
------------
Unfortunately this application only really works with specific dictionaries.
Word definitions have to be in plain text, separated by newlines.
